2.  total annual incidental bycatch (metric tons) from the commercial halibut longline fishery (Table 2);  
3.  total annual catch (metric tons) from the sport fishery from 1996 â€“ present (Table 3);  
4.  estimates of yelloweye density (individuals per square kilometer) derived from ADF&G submarine and 
    remote operated vehicle (ROV) bottom surveys (Table 4);  
5.  estimates of total rockfish habitat per management area in square kilometers derived from sonar and     
    other bathymetric surveys (Table 4);  
6.  age composition data from the commercial fishery;  
7.  commercial fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) derived from logbooks and fish tickets;  
8.  International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) longline survey bycatch CPUE from IPHC survey logs;
